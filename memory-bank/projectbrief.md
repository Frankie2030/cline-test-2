# Project Brief: Chatbot System

## 1. Project Overview

This project is to create a web-based chatbot system with user authentication and a basic query-and-answer chatbot powered by the Gemini API. Users will be able to register, log in, and interact with the chatbot.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. User Authentication
- **User Registration:** New users can create an account by providing a unique username and a password.
- **User Login:** Registered users can log in to the application using their username and password.
- **Session Management:** The system will maintain user sessions, keeping them logged in until they explicitly log out.

### 2.2. Chatbot Functionality
- **Query and Answer:** Users can submit queries to the chatbot and receive answers generated by the Gemini API.
- **Conversation History:** The chatbot will maintain a history of the conversation within the current session.

## 3. Target Audience

- Users seeking a simple and interactive chatbot experience.
- Developers looking for an example of integrating a chatbot with user authentication.

## 4. Technical Requirements

- **Frontend:** Streamlit for building the interactive chatbot interface.
- **Backend:** FastAPI for handling user authentication, managing chatbot interactions, and integrating with the Gemini API.
- **Database:** SQLite for storing user credentials (usernames and hashed passwords).
- **External API:** Gemini API for chatbot responses.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** The chatbot interface should be intuitive and easy to use.
- **Performance:** The chatbot should provide responsive answers with minimal latency.
- **Security:** User passwords must be securely hashed and stored.
- **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a growing number of users and queries.
