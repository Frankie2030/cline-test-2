# Development and Deployment for Chatbot System

- Use Git for version control; follow clear commit message conventions (e.g., feat: add authentication endpoint).
- Use pip for Python package management; keep dependencies minimal with requirements.txt.
- Organize code with a clear project structure (e.g., separate modules for auth, chat, database).
- Use environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., JWT secrets, database paths, Gemini API keys).
- Implement automated testing with pytest for backend endpoints and core functionality.
- Use FastAPI's built-in documentation features (Swagger UI) for API documentation.
- Deploy with a Python-compatible platform like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Docker containers.
