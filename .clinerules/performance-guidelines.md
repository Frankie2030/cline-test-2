# Performance Guidelines

## Performance Optimization
- Optimize FastAPI endpoints for minimal latency, especially for Gemini API interactions.
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data (e.g., user sessions, common chatbot responses).
- Minimize data transfer over WebSockets by sending only necessary updates.
- Use efficient SQLite queries and ensure proper indexing for user authentication data.
- Optimize Streamlit application performance by using `st.cache_data` and `st.cache_resource` for expensive computations or resource loading.
- Implement rate limiting for external API calls (e.g., Gemini API) to prevent abuse and manage costs.
- Ensure efficient processing of chatbot queries and responses to provide a responsive user experience.
- Consider asynchronous operations in FastAPI for I/O-bound tasks like API calls.
